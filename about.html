      <h2>How this prosject began</h2>
      <p>The idea for this project started a little over a year ago when Kevin, one of the cofounders of this idea was looking to diversifying his positions in the stock market. He was eager to invest green, and contribute to the environment, but the green stocks are overpriced, and most often an investment in a green stock wont resolve in climate issues. So, he started looking after ways to directly contribute to green energy, and with not much luck. He started to wonder if there maybe was a marked for crowdfunding of green energy, he could not be the only one looking for a solution like this?</p>  
      <p>Fast forward one year and he and his cofounders were challenges to develop a solution for the UN-sustainability goals. So, Kevin teamed up with Elias, and Jonathan and choose to further develop this idea and here we are, three guys trying to change the world.</p>
