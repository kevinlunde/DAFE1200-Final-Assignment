      <h1>Get Sol</h1>
      <p>When you want to get Sol Energy you will have to fill out the form on this page. If you have selected a solar array already and only want the investors you can fill out <a>“this form”</a>. And if you have not made any arrangement about what solar array you want, we can help you with that too, then u have to fill out <a>“this form”</a>, and we will take care of the rest.</P> 
      <p>By being a part of this project, you will help the environment a lot, you will be part of getting rid of coal and gas as a power-source. It will also have an impact on not building as much windmills, which are bad for birds, or building large scale solar parks which take up huge landsites. <a href="why.html">“learn more”</a></p>
      <p>When filling out the form it’s a few things that can be nice to be aware of. You have the option to not be a part of the investment, but you can also be one of the investors if you want. You have also the option to buy back parts of the solar array either through monthly buybacks, or by making a deal with the investors.</p>  
      <p>A little about the process, after you have filled out the form, we will contact you and make a contract before your project go live. After the project goes live, the investors will see your project and begin putting down an investment. When our money-goal is reached we will be beginning the process of paying out the invested money to the ones who are installing the solar array. </p>
