         <h2>Solar invest is an investment strategy with the goal of providing clean electricity to everyone.</h2> 
         <p>
             At Solar Invest we provide the means for companies and other interested parties to have solar arrays built on their buildings. This will be crowdfunded by anyone looking to invest in the available solar panels. In return, the investors will profit from the long-term investment and the companies will benefit from a more green alternative to the power grid.
         </p>
         <p>
             In an ever-evolving world there is a growing need for electricity. Not only that, but we have a need to shift from “dirty” to new clean electricity. We want to help in two ways: firstly, giving people/companies/government the means to take advantage of solar energy. And secondly, we provide a smarter, more reliable, and more sustainable solution than other power suppliers. Instead of leeching from the power grid, we want to expand the virtual power plant.
         </p>
         <p>
             We want everyone to be able to power their home with clean energy. Maybe you would like to get your company carbon free. Or maybe you don’t want to support the use of coal power plants. That’s why we Sol Invest offer our services to build more solar panels either as a private person, company or government. As a client you only pay the electricity, which will cost the same as from any other power suppliers.
         </p>
         <p>
             The way this project will be financed is through crowdfunding. Everyone can participate by investing money in a project of their choosing, and will expect a return by selling the produced electricity directly to the client.

            <h3>Decentralizing the Power Grid</h3>
            <p>Decentralization of the power grid is commonly referred to as the virtual power plant. <br>This has both sustainable and financial advantages:</p>
            <p>5% of the energy produced at a power plant is lost in transmission on the power-grid, when building solar where the demand for electricity is, we will have huge energy savings.<sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>When the power is produced where it is used, we don’t need as huge of an investment in the power-grid, saving the power company and thereby the consumer for a lot of money.</p>
            <p>We will have fewer power outages by splitting huge power plants into smaller ones. Therefore, if a power outage occurs, those who have solar installed will still have power.</p>

           <h3>For the investor</h3>
           <p>Do a safe investment that helps build a green future, that also invests directly in green energy compared to green stocks, which only make the stock prices rise without doing a direct contribution to the environment.</p>
            <p>In the US it is estimated that it takes 8 years to repay the initial solar investment. Giving solar a 12.5% yearly revenue, beating the stock market averaging around 9.2%.<sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source2">[2]</a></sup>
            <sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source3">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Monthly payment for the energy your investment has produced.</p>
            <p>Buyback options, and the possibility to sell your ownership to other people.</p>
            <p>Low entry level, you can pay as little as 10$ per project giving everyone the possibility to participate and diversifying your positions.</p>
            <P>Helping drive down the price of solar by investing in it.</P>
