            <h3>Decentralization of the power grid, commonly referred to as the virtual grid has huge advantages</h3>
            <p>8-15% of the energy produced at a powerplant is lost in transmission on the power-grid, when building solar where the demand for electricety is, we will have huge energy savings</p>
            <p>When the power is produced where it is used, we donâ€™t need as huge of an investment in the power-grid, saving the power company and thereby the consumer for a lot of money.</p>
            <p>We will have fever power outages by splitting huge power plant into smaller ones. And if there is a full out power outage, those who have solar installed will still have power.</p>
