         <h2>Solar invest is an investment strategy with the goal of providing clean electricity to everyone.</h2> 
         <p>At Solar Invest we provide the means for companies and other interested parties, to have solar arrays built for their buildings which are crowdfunded by anyone looking into investing in the available solar panels. In return, the investors will profit from the long-term investment and the companies will benefit from a greener alternative to the power grid.</p>
         <p>In an ever-evolving world there is a growing need for electricity. Not only that but we have a need to shift from dirty, to new clean electricity. We want to help in two ways, helping people/companies/government build more solar, and we want to do it in a smarter way than the power companies, by helping build the virtual grid.</p>
         <p>We want to offer clean electric energy to everyone, so if you want clean energy, we offer to build solar for you, for free. Maybe you would like to get your company carbon free. Or do not want your house electricity to come from a coal powerplant. Maybe you want to install solar in a public government, but do not have the money. Then we will give you the option to get clean energy, and only pay the same price for the electricity as you would pay to your power-company. </p>
         <p>The way this project will be financed is through crowdfunding, where everyone can participate by giving money to a project by their choosing , and will be paid back by selling the power from their solar array.

           <p>The opportunity to be an investor on your own solar panels, and giving you the option to buy back the solar array bit by bit when you have the money.</p>
           <p>Making it easier to get to a carbon-free home/business/city.</p>

            <h3>Decentralizing the Power Grid</h3>
            <p>Decentralization of the power grid is commonly referred to as the virtual grid. <br>This has both sustainable and financial advantages:</p>
            <p>5% of the energy produced at a powerplant is lost in transmission on the power-grid, when building solar where the demand for electricety is, we will have huge energy savings.<sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>When the power is produced where it is used, we don’t need as huge of an investment in the power-grid, saving the power company and thereby the consumer for a lot of money.</p>
            <p>We will have fewer power outages by splitting huge power plants into smaller ones. Therefore, if a power outage occurs, those who have solar installed will still have power.</p>

           <h3>For the investor</h3>
           <p>Do a safe investment that helps building a green future, that also invest directly in green energy compared to green stocks, which only make the stock prices rise without doing a direct contribution to the environment.</p>
            <p>In the US it is estimated that it takes 8 years to repay the initial solar investment. Giving solar a 12.5% yearly revenue, beating the stock market averaging around 9.2%.<sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source2">[2]</a></sup>
            <sup><a class="source-item" href="Sources.html#source3">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Monthly payment for the energy your investment has produced.</p>
            <p>Buyback options, and the possibility to sell your ownership to other people.</p>
            <p>Low entry level, you can pay as little as 10$ per project giving everyone the possibility to participate and diversifying your positions.</p>
            <P>Helping drive down the price of solar by investing in it.</P>
