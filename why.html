      <h1>Why Sol?</h1>
      <div id="why-statement">
         <h2>Solar invest is an investment strategy to getting clean electricity to everyone</h2> 
         <p>In an ever-evolving world there is a growing need for electricity. Not only that we   have a need to shift from dirty, to new clean electricity. We want to help in two ways, helping people/companies/government build more solar, and we want to do it in a smarter way than the power companies. 
         We want to offer clean electric energy to everyone, so if you want clean energy, we offer to build it for you for free. Maybe you want to want to get your company carbon free. Or do not want your house electricity to come from a could powerplant. Or maybe you want to install solar in a public community, but don’t have the money. Then we will give you the option to get clean energy, only pay the same price for the electricity as you would pay to the power-company. Not only will you be helping by polluting less, you would also help building the virtual grid, which also will help the environment a lot. 
         The way this project will be financed is through crowdfunding, where everyone can participate by giving money to a project by their choosing , and will be paid back by selling the power from their solar array.

            <h3>Decentralization of the power grid, commonly referred to as the virtual grid has huge advantages</h3>
            <p>8-15% of the energy produced at a powerplant is lost in transmission on the power-grid, when building solar where the demand for electricety is, we will have huge energy savings.</p>
            <p>When the power is produced where it is used, we don’t need as huge of an investment in the power-grid, saving the power company and thereby the consumer for a lot of money.</p>
            <p>We will have fever power outages by splitting huge power plant into smaller ones. And if there is a full out power outage, those who have solar installed will still have power.</p>

           <h3>For the investor</h3>
           <p>Do a safe investment that helps building a green future. That also invest directly in green energy compared to green stocks, which only make the stock prices rice without doing a direct contribution to the envirement.</p>
            <p>In the US it is estimated that it takes 8 years to repay the initial solar investment. Giving solar a 12.5% yearly revenue, beating the stock market averaging around 9.2%. </p>
            <p>Monthly payment for the energy your investment has produced.</p>
            <p>Buyback options, and the possibility to sell your ownership to other persons.</p>
            <p>Low entry level, you can pay as little as 10$ per project giving everyone the possibility to participate and diversifying your positions.</p>
            <P>Helping drive down the price of solar by investing in it.</P>
